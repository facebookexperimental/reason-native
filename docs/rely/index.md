Rely is a strongly typed, [Jest-like](https://jestjs.io/) native test framework with blazing fast performance ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥.

It comes with built in support for both traditional and snapshot testing, and bootstraps tests in **milliseconds**.

```re
describe("Example", describeUtils => {
  let test = describeUtils.test;
  test("ints", ({expect}) =>
    expect.int(7).toBe(5)
  );
  test("bools", ({expect}) =>
    expect.bool(true).not.toBe(false)
  );
});
```
